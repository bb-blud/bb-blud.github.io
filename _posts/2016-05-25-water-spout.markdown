This is a prototype for a drum machine/synthesizer app with the intention of being super fun and addictive.
It was my final sketch for _"Creative Programing For digital media and mobile Apps"_ by proffs Grillies, Yee-King,
Grierson on Coursera. Its written in Processing and parsed to javascript with processing.js.  

You can find the mess of files [here](http://github.com/bb-blud/water_spout). 
My intention now is to rewrite a new and improved version in pure JavaScript using the [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) library. You can try it out [here](https://bb-blud.github.io/water_spout) :)
